# Python-Challenge
Module 3 Challenge

## PyBank Overview
For this challenge, I used a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company. Using the budget_data.csv datset, I created a Python script to analyze the records to calculate each of the following values:
* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

My analysis yielded the following results:
