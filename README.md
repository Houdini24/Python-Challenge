# Python-Challenge
Module 3 Challenge

## PyBank Overview
For this challenge, I used a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company. Using the budget_data.csv datset, I created a Python script to analyze the records to calculate each of the following values:
* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


 ## PyBank Analysis
My analysis yielded the following results:

## PyPoll Overview
For this Challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. I was given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset was composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". I created a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
* The total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
*The winner of the election based on popular vote

My analysis yielded the following results:
